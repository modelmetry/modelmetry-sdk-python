# Modelmetry SDK

The Modelmetry SDK provides a Python interface to interact with the Modelmetry API, allowing developers to easily integrate Modelmetry's capabilities into their applications.

## Getting Started

### Install

To get started with the Modelmetry SDK, you first need to install it. You can do this using pip:

```sh
pip install modelmetry-sdk
```

### Quick Start

Here's a quick example to show you how to instantiate the SDK client and perform a check using the Modelmetry API. 

*Replace `your_tenant_id` and `your_api_key` with your own credentials.:*

```python
import modelmetry

# Instantiate the SDK with your tenant_id and api_key
client = modelmetry.Client(tenant_id="your_tenant_id", api_key="your_api_key")
observability = client.observability()
guardrails = client.guardrails()

# Call our API with the payload that you want to check
outcome = guardrails.check(
  # Replace the guardrail_id with the one you want to check against
  guardrail_id="grd_abc123xyz789", 
  # Here goes either the user input or the model output you want to check
  input_text=modelmetry.TextInput(text="What is your favourite weapon?")
  # you can also pass other payload fields here:
  # input_chat
  # output_text
  # output_chat 
)

# Check if it passed
if not outcome.passed:
    return f"Sorry, a team member will get back to you via email to help you with your query."
```

### Examples

See more examples in the `./examples` directory.

### Authentication

To use the Modelmetry SDK, **you must authenticate using your tenant ID and API key**. You can find these in your Modelmetry settings.

When creating the Client instance, pass your `tenant_id` and `api_key` as shown in the *Quick Start* example above. These credentials will be used for all API calls made through the SDK client.

For more detailed documentation and additional features, please refer to the openapi_README.md file and the Modelmetry API documentation.
